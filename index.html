                <h3 class="subtitle-font">AI-Driven Warehouse Route Optimization</h3>
                <p><strong>What:</strong> Built a Python simulation (August 2025) to optimize warehouse routes in a 10x10 factory layout with 50 randomized shelves, cutting travel distance by 26.47% using a greedy algorithm (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas). Engineered a realistic warehouse model with labeled shelves (S1-S50) and cross-shaped aisles, analyzed with Pandas.</p>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> Demonstrates ISE logistics optimization, delivering 26.47% efficiency gains in a simulated factory setting, relevant for e-commerce. Offers a data-driven approach applicable to manufacturing industries.</p>
                <p><strong>Future:</strong> Plan to integrate genetic algorithms by late 2025 to optimize shelf placement and routes, enhancing overall efficiency. Intend to expand to multi-picker scenarios and dynamic order batching with clustering techniques in 2026, enabling scalability for larger warehouses.</p>
