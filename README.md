This repository hosts the official website for the Liberty University Rocketry Team. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a space-themed design inspired by SpaceX and NASA. It includes sections for projects, team members, sponsors, technical reports, a resume book, and contact information. The home page provides updates, featured images signup, and an "About Us" section. With much more to come.
